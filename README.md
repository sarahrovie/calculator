## Process

This website was made with all the knowledge I've acquired of the fundamentals of programming during the TOP Foundations course! It was a fun and interesting experience to develop a calculator, from the UI design to the actual code and logic behind the operations.

With this project I was also able to improve my skills with Git, by working through a local and remote repository, creating branches to add and edit new features, as well as merging and pushing them to GitHub.
